# 🚀 PrivateData Marketplace - Smart Contract Deployment Guide

## ✅ What You Now Have

### Enhanced Smart Contracts with Professional Features

**🔥 High Priority Enhancements Implemented:**

1. **Cross-Contract Integration** ✅
   ```clarity
   ;; Automatic privacy verification when creating listings
   (contract-call? .data-privacy get-privacy-certification data-hash)
   
   ;; Integrated reputation updates after purchases  
   (contract-call? .reputation-system update-data-quality-score seller u105)
   ```

2. **Purchase ID System** ✅
   ```clarity
   (define-data-var next-purchase-id uint u1)
   ;; Every purchase gets unique tracking ID
   ```

3. **Listing Expiration** ✅
   ```clarity
   expires-at: uint  ;; Block-height based expiration
   ;; Auto-expiration with seller extension capability
   ```

## 🎯 Key Contract Enhancements

### 1. Cross-Contract Integration
- **Marketplace** automatically verifies privacy certification before allowing listings
- **Purchase flow** triggers reputation updates across contracts
- **Seamless contract-to-contract communication**

### 2. Enhanced Purchase System
```clarity
;; New purchase tracking
(define-map data-purchases
  { purchase-id: uint }
  {
    buyer: principal,
    listing-id: uint,
    price-paid: uint,
    purchased-at: uint,
    access-granted: bool
  }
)
```

### 3. Time-Based Listing Management
```clarity
;; Listings now have expiration
(define-public (create-listing ... duration-blocks))
(define-public (extend-listing listing-id additional-blocks))
(define-read-only (is-listing-expired-check listing-id))
```

### 4. Integrated Workflows
```clarity
;; One-transaction privacy certification + listing creation
(define-public (certify-and-create-listing 
  category description price privacy-level-num 
  data-hash metadata-uri duration-blocks anonymization-method))
```

## 🛠️ Professional Development Commands

```bash
# Contract Validation & Analysis
yarn clarinet:check      # Validate all contracts
