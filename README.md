## 💡 How to Use

1. **Create a Data Listing**  
   Sellers can list datasets with privacy certification and metadata.

2. **Purchase Data**  
   Buyers purchase access to datasets; payments are split automatically.

3. **Rate Sellers**  
   After purchase, buyers can rate sellers to build reputation.

4. **Access Control**  
   Only buyers who paid can access purchased data.

### Example Contract Calls

```clarity
;; Create a listing
(contract-call? .marketplace create-listing 
  "Customer Demographics" 
  "Anonymized customer data" 
  u1000000 
  u2

;; Purchase data
